## initialize vs instantiate
The difference is that 
- initiation is stuff that gets done, initialization refers to naming that instance by assigning the variable name to that instance.

e.g. var number = 12;

- instantiation is creation of a thing that can do stuff, Instantiation refers to the allocation of memory to create an instance of a class whereas 

e.g. Person person01 = new Person();

## sealed modifier
sealed can only be applied to the derived classes that has override or abstract modifiers, generally don't use sealed, unless if you have real good reason to use it.
